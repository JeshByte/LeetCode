So we need to find a pair (i,j) where i<j and price[j]-price[i] is maximum and >0. So this problem becomes easier when we visualise the points as a curve. Lets take the array - 2 5 3 1 6 4. So an observation can be made that for a particular point it only makes sense to check for profit till we reach a point that is less than it. Thus, here when we are checking for 2 we should consider only till 3. Because after that, there is 1 which is less than 2. Now there can be points after 1 which are greater than 2 and will generate profit but we can say for sure that there difference with 1 will always be more. So no need to check them with 2 anymore. So now we can directly go to 1 and start checking from 6 onwards. On a curve, this would look like as if we only consider the dips and compare it with the other points only till we reach another new dip. This logic can be easily implemented in O(n) using 2 pointer method.
