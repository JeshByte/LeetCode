We can see that if we sort the given array, a parent folder will always be present before its child folder. So we can just go through the array, take the current folder and the last valid non-subfolder and check if the non-subfolder is a prefix of the current folder or not. We can do this by using the find function. If it is a prefix then we would ignore it otherwise we will add it to our answer vector.
