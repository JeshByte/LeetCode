So we need to choose 4 points at a time. 2 of these points need to have same y coordinate and the other 2 also need to have same y coordinate but different from the other 2. Thus our first step should be to group the points as per their y coordinate in a map. Now here we need to make 2 choices. First one is to decide the 2 y groups from where we will take 2 points each. And then the second decision is the 2 points we need to take from each group. So the number of ways to take 2 points from a group of n points is n*(n-1)/2. So we will have to take 2 groups at a time and find their contributions and sum them up. But this will take n^2 time which will give tle. Here we will need to use a trick. Let's assume we have an array with every y group's contribution and it is [12,3,4,6]. Now the total contribution of the pairings involving the first group will be 12*3+12*4+12*6 which simplifies to 12*(3+4+6). So to find the total contribution of a group we just need the suffix sum after that element. So using this trick we would be able to get our answer in O(n).
