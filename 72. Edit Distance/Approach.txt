So we can look at this problem in a similar way to LCS in terms of the logic flow. Lets maintain two pointers for each of the words pointing to each letter one by one. The pointer in the first word will move forward when a letter has been handled(deleted,converted, or it can remain without hindering our goal) and the pointer in the second word will move forward when we have secured that letter in our final word(inserted,converted, or was already in the first word). Following this approach we can solve the problem using a 2D dp approach with the following states and transitions in O(n*m) time - 
- dp[i][j] = minimum operations needed to convert the prefix of word1 till i into the prefix of word2 till j
- dp[n][m] = 0 --> This is our base case. This means the entire word1 has been converted to word2, so no more operations needed.
- If i<=n && j<=m (this means there are letters left in word1 to be handled and letters in word2 left to be ensured) then -
     - If word1[i] == word2[j] (both the letters in this position are same) then dp[i][j]=0+dp[i+1][j+1]. This means we can use the letter from word1 itself. So both the letters from word1 and word2 get
       handled/ensured together without any operations.
     - Else dp[i][j]=1+min(dp[i][j+1],dp[i+1][j],dp[i+1][j+1]). This means as the letters are not same, they can't be used as it is. So some operation needs to be done. Either we insert the needed letter(j++ but           not i), or delete the letter from word1(i++ but not j), or convert/replace the letter from word1 with the needed one(both i++ and j++). We will take the minimum of these cases.
- Else if i>=n && j<m (this means all the letters of word1 are handled but we still have some letters left from word2 to be ensured) then dp[i][j]=1+dp[i][j+1]. This means we will need insert the needed letters in this case.
- Else if i<n && j>=m (this means all the letters of word2 are ensured i.e. we have got the needed word but still there are some redundant letters from word1 needed to be handled) then dp[i][j]=1+dp[i+1][j]. This means we will need to delete these extra letters.
- dp[0][0] = final subproblem to be solved as initially all the letters of word1 and word2 need to be handled/ensured.
